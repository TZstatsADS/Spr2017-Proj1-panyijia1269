![image](figs/title.jpg)

### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: "The analysis of inaugurals during 1913~1953"
+ This project is conducted by [Yijia Pan]

+ Project summary: During 1931~1953, many big things happened such as the World War I, the World War II and the Great Depression. So I want to do a research on what presidents have said during these period.
